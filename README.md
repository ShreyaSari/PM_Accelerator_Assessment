## üìÇ Dataset

- **Name:** Global Weather Repository  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Global Weather Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/code)  
- **Description:** Contains daily weather information from cities around the globe with over **40+ features**, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and more.

## üîç Project Overview

### ‚úÖ Basic Assessment

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values and outliers.
  - Normalized relevant features for modeling.
  - Converted time-related columns to datetime format.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Identified seasonal patterns in temperature and precipitation.
  - Correlation analysis between temperature, humidity, and air quality.
  - Visualized trends using line charts, heatmaps, and bar plots.

- **Model Building:**
  - Used `lastupdated` as the time-series anchor.
  - Developed a baseline forecasting model.
  - Evaluated model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ scores.

### üöÄ Advanced Assessment

- **Advanced EDA:**
  - Detected and analyzed anomalies in climate patterns.
  - Clustered similar weather profiles using K-Means.

- **Forecasting Models Implemented:**
  1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
     - Time-series model suitable for stationary data.
  2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)**  
     - Deep learning model to capture sequential patterns.
  3. **Random Forest Regressor**  
     - Ensemble learning model to understand feature interactions.

- **Model Comparison & Ensemble:**
  - Compared the models based on forecasting accuracy.
  - Created an ensemble to combine model predictions for enhanced performance.

- **Unique Analyses:**
  - **Climate Analysis:** Studied regional climate variation over time.
  - **Air Quality Impact:** Correlated AQI with temperature, wind, and humidity.
  - **Feature Importance:** Used SHAP & permutation importance to rank features.
  - **Spatial Analysis:** Visualized geographic distribution of weather trends using maps and GeoPandas.
